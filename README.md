# FAQ Common Questions

**Q: How accurate are AI detection tools for mixed human-AI content?**
A: Most advanced tools like Originality.AI and GPTZero achieve 85-95% accuracy on mixed content, highlighting specific AI-generated sections rather than just providing overall scores, though accuracy decreases when AI content is heavily edited by humans.

**Q: Can AI detection tools identify all AI writing models?**
A: Current tools primarily detect popular models like GPT-3, GPT-4, and Claude, but new AI models may temporarily evade detection until tools update their algorithms, which typically happens within weeks of new model releases.

**Q: Do AI detectors work on paraphrased or translated AI content?**
A: Advanced platforms like Copyleaks and ContentScale can detect paraphrased AI content by analyzing semantic patterns, while translation adds complexity that may reduce detection accuracy to 70-80% depending on the language pair.
